# ROS2 Development Environment

This is a Docker-based environment for ROS2 (Humble) package development that I use for development.

## Overview

This repository provides a containerized ROS2 Humble development workspace for building, testing, and running ROS2 packages. It includes pre-configured Docker setup and example packages to get you started quickly.

## Repository Structure

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
cd ros2-docker
./build.sh
```

### 2. Start the Container

```bash
./start.sh
```

### 3. Enter the Container

```bash
./bash.sh
```

### 4. Build ROS2 Packages

Inside the container:

```bash
cd ~/ros2-dev
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 5. Run Example Nodes

```bash
# Using ros2 run
ros2 run ros2_tutorials publisher_node

# Using ros2 launch
ros2 launch ros2_tutorials tutorial_launch.py
```
